Steps to follow to program badge:

Remove power source (9V battery)

Remove MCU (arduino pro mini)

Plug MCU into Serial USB adapter.

Program MCU over USB via Arduino IDE (or avrdude if you're daring).

Notes:
This can (in theory) be done with the arduino in the badge, BUT!!!
Make sure you disconnect or depower the XBee.
