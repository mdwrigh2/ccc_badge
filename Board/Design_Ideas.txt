Alex here, just getting out some ideas for the design:

LED's on TX/RX.  They're pretty and flashy and fun.
LED's on XBee: ON and ASSOC.  Useful for debugging.

Slider input requires two Analog pins. No getting around this.

The buttons can be haxxored using resistors values ~1K,2K,4K,8K
    these will encode the button state into what is pretty much a hex digit.

    To adjust for this we need:
    * Calibration mode, to adjust for variation in the resistor values

    Also, realize that analog reads take some time, and having a button
    pressed for only part of the duration will result in a bad combo.

    To deal with this we need to do two consecutive reads, and if they don't
    match then throw it out as bad input and try again.

    The circuit is pretty much a resistor ladder, and pressing the button
    will short out the corresponding resistor.

uzzer on a spare digital pin.
Any remaining pins go to LED's.

Reset button on MCU is tied to both GLCD and XBee, so it acts as a universal
    reset button for the whole badge.

We *could* include the USB-programmers, but lets not for this year.  6-pin
    serial headers is good enough for now. (DefCon badge had this, but 
    ninja badge did not)

Holes in 4 corners must be big enough for 'lanyard' clips... for whatever
    we end up using for lanyards.

ART ART ART ART ART. we should have art on it....
    except the copper side is on the back. shit.

We (at one point) discussed lasercutting a case-ish-thing for the badge.
    We'll see on this one. I'm thinking probably not.

Power Source: 9V Battery. Regulated by a 5V Reg (MCU and LCD) and 3V3 Reg
    (XBee). Probably duct tape battery to back of badge.
    Off switch is unplugging battery


RESISTORS. For all LEDs. Its a must.

Programming Headers:  
    * MCU - program the arduino on the badge
    * XBee - program the XBee on the badge
