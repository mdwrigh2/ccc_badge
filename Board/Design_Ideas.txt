Alex here, just getting out some ideas for the design:

LED's on TX/RX.  They're pretty and flashy and fun.
LED's on XBee: ON and ASSOC.  Useful for debugging.

Slider input requires two Analog pins. No getting around this.

The buttons can be haxxored using resistors values ~1K,2K,4K,8K
    these will encode the button state into what is pretty much a hex digit.

    To adjust for this we need:
    * Calibration mode, to adjust for variation in the resistor values

    Also, realize that analog reads take some time, and having a button
    pressed for only part of the duration will result in a bad combo.

    To deal with this we need to do two consecutive reads, and if they don't
    match then throw it out as bad input and try again.

    The circuit is pretty much a resistor ladder, and pressing the button
    will short out the corresponding resistor.

Buzzer on a spare digital pin.
Any remaining pins go to LED's.
